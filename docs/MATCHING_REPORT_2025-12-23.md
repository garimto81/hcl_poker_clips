## 문제 해결

### 원인 분석

NAS 파일명에 **YouTube Video ID**와 **포맷 코드**가 포함되어 유사도가 85% 미만으로 떨어짐:

```
NAS: Wesley Gets Coolered!! NUTS vs 2nd NUTS!! [HHX6kVnMUpw]
Sheet: Wesley Gets Coolered!! NUTS vs 2nd NUTS!!
유사도: 85.42% → 임계값(85%) 근처에서 불안정
```

### 해결 방법

`src/sync/matching/normalizer.py`에 YouTube ID 및 포맷 코드 제거 로직 추가:

```python
# YouTube Video ID 패턴 (11자 영숫자+특수문자)
YOUTUBE_ID_PATTERN = r'\s*\[[A-Za-z0-9_-]{11}\]$'

# 확장자/포맷 코드 패턴
FORMAT_CODE_PATTERN = r'\.f\d{3}$'  # .f399, .f140 등
```

### 결과

- 매칭 실패: 21개 → **0개**
- 정규화 일치: 183개 → **581개** (+398개가 fuzzy에서 normalized로 이동)

## 패턴 분석

### 정규화 일치 주요 패턴
- **물음표(??) 차이**: `Tom Dwan With 7 High` vs `Tom Dwan With 7 High??`
- **공백 차이**: `Hustler Casino Live` vs `HustlerCasinoLive`
- **특수문자 차이**: `#$%` vs `#$%*`, `/` vs 공백

### 유사도 매칭 주요 패턴
- **확장자 잔여물**: `.f399` 접미사 (97% 유사도)
- **YouTube ID 포함**: `[xVZ5XqCSl_I]` 접미사 (93-94% 유사도)
- **파이프(|) 구분자**: `| From The Archive` (93% 유사도)

### 매칭 실패 주요 패턴
- **짧은 제목**: 긴 제목 대비 짧은 파일명
- **YouTube ID만 포함**: 제목 정보 부족
- **시트에 미등록**: 새로운 영상으로 추정

---

## 권장 조치

1. ~~**미매칭 21개 파일**: Google Sheets에 수동 추가 필요~~ ✅ 해결됨
2. ~~**임계값 조정**: 현재 85% → 80%로 낮추면 추가 매칭 가능~~ ✅ 불필요
3. **시트 제목 정규화**: 특수문자, 공백 통일 권장 (선택)

### 완료된 수정사항

- `src/sync/matching/normalizer.py`에 YouTube ID 제거 패턴 추가
- `src/sync/matching/normalizer.py`에 포맷 코드(.f399) 제거 패턴 추가
- `normalize_standard()` 메서드에서 자동 적용
